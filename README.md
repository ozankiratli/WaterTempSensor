# WaterTempSensor

This project is built to make multiple temperature measurements from water.

This code works with DS18x20 temperature sensors and LCD with serial connection (I2C) module. 

The original code is using a 16x2 LCD with serial connection module that has a PCF8574AT chip, you might need to change LCD address according to it.
